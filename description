This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) population data to understand trends, growth patterns, and distribution across different regions. Using Python and data visualization tools, we explored key metrics such as vehicle types, model popularity, manufacturer dominance, and geographic distribution of EVs.
The project aimed to uncover insights into the adoption of electric vehicles and identify areas with high EV density or potential for infrastructure development (e.g., charging stations).
