🔍 Key Objectives I Explored:
1️⃣ Average Electric Range: BEVs vs. PHEVs
 📏 Compared real-world average range values to understand efficiency gaps and usage trends.
2️⃣ Effectiveness of Clean Fuel Incentives
 💸 Analyzed adoption spikes linked to incentive periods, revealing policy impact.
3️⃣ EV Affordability vs. Accessibility Index by District
 📍 Mapped how cost vs. charging infrastructure accessibility varies by region.
4️⃣ EV Popularity by Base MSRP
 📈 Assessed how pricing influences vehicle type preference and regional demand.
5️⃣ Charging Readiness by City
 🔌 Visualized which cities are most prepared for an EV boom based on charger availability.
6️⃣ EV Adoption Over the Years
 📅 Tracked the evolution of EV registrations and identified key growth periods.
🔮 BONUS: Forecasting the Future I implemented Excel’s Forecast Sheet tool to predict indicator trends over the next 7 years. 💡 This adds a predictive layer to the dashboard — not just what has happened, but what might happen next!
